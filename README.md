# Scraping_Tokyo_Sushi_Restaurant
## What is Tabelog?  
Tabelog is an online restaurant information website. We can search restaurants using filters, and see the information about restaurants. For example, menus, addresses, contact information, photos, scores (ratings), and reviews. (It is like a OpenTable or Yelp.)

## Goal:
If you are interested in opening a sushi restaurant in Tokyo, this project is for you! We will acquire restaurant information from Tabelog to practice scraping. We focus on sushi restaurants in Tokyo!

We will extract sushi restaurant information including: 　　

Restaurant names
Average scores
Number of reviews
Reviews (for dinner) 　
At the end of this project, we will get two dataframes as CSV files. One is about restaurants, and another is about reviews!

## Table of Contents:
1. Import the packages
2. Get the restaurant names and the restaurant page URLs from the search result
3. Get the average scores of the restaurants, the numbers of the reviews, and the URLs which the reviews are stored in
4. Make a restaurant dataframe
5. Get the reviews of each restaurant
6. Summary
